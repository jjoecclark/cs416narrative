            <p>COVID-19 was and still is a major public health concern. The plot below shows the cumulative number of COVI-19 cases in 2020 for each state. By inspecting the plot, it is clear that the US as a whole experienced a surge of cases throughout the year. However, different states in different regions had different trends with respect to COVID-19 cases. Select a state and a time range from the drop down to drill down into specific states and time periods to examine how separate areas of the country were impacted by COVID-19 cases.</p>
